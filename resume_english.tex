\begin{rSection}{\faUsers~Projects}
    % TODO add a Java backend project
    \begin{rProject}{School Research}{The SHLL Programming language}{2022.01-Now}
        \textbf{Reasons}: SHLL is a programming language for researching high-level compiler optimization, hoping facilitate development of High-Frequency Trading software. SHLL borrows some ideas from a similar school project, which is badly written, but has more engineering, aesthetic and agronomical considerations\\
        \textbf{Development}: Build a user-friendly, beautiful language, which utilizing analyzing code, specialization and inlining to eliminate abstraction cost, achieving the true zero-cost abstraction. Use scala 3 as the front-end language, to ensure expressiveness of the language
    \end{rProject}
    \begin{rProject}{Personal Project}{Unidef}{2021.07-Now}
        \textbf{项目概述}: Unidef a tool for type to type conversion across languages, for code generation and transpilation. Written originally in Python but written in Scala\\
        \textbf{项目开发}: maintain a set of ASts, which try to keep all nuance of source languages and be language netural and consistent. It supports JSON, Json Schema, FIX, primary programming languages. It's also the base for SHLL
    \end{rProject}
    % \begin{rProject}{Collaborated Project}{WP-Reliable MD}{Sep 2018-Aug 2019}
    %     \textbf{Reasons}: Since the Markdown plugin I was using ceased to develop, my friends and I managed to introduce the Markdown Tui-Editor to WordPress Plugin Marketplace\\

    %         \item Project Development: Redesign the GUI for Tui-Editor and replaced the original editor of WordPress. Adopted a RESTful API to render MarkDown text to work around the incapacity of rendering LaTeX math equations in places other than plaintext. Use a non-intrusive approach to avoid data lose and inconsistency when the plugin is down.
