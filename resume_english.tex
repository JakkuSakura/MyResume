    % TODO add a Java backend project
    \begin{rProject}{Collaborated Project}{WP-Reliable MD}{Sep 2018-Aug 2019}
        \textbf{Reasons}: Since the Markdown plugin I was using ceased to develop, my friends and I managed to introduce the Markdown Tui-Editor to WordPress Plugin Marketplace\\
        \textbf{Duties}
        \begin{itemize}
            \itemsep -0.5em \vspace{-0.5em}
            \item Project Management: As the team leader, I proposed the overall architecture and technical choice. I was also in charge of early development
            \item Project Development: Redesign the GUI for Tui-Editor and replaced the original editor of WordPress. Adopted a RESTful API to render MarkDown text to work around the incapacity of rendering LaTeX math equations in places other than plaintext. Use a non-intrusive approach to avoid data lose and inconsistency when the plugin is down.
        \end{itemize}
